# Game-Studio-1

A repository for the game created for Game Design Stuio 1 at UTS. 

The game in question is an infinite space runner where you play as a spaceship zooming through space. Using the mouse, dodge and weave through thousands of asteroids, planets, supernovas, blackholes, and the strange entity at the end of the universe. Unlock upgrades, weapons, and new levels in your quest to find the ultimate truth about the cosmos. Will you survive the grand journey? Or will you perish, like all those before you. Either way, the universe in a large place, and you will not be missed.

All tasks to do in Hyperpocalypse before showcase:


- Prompt to choose NORMAL or RUSH mode that'll just run one of these lines of code:     
GameProgression.instance.SetProgressionMode(ProgressionMode.SLOW);   //NORMAL
or
GameProgression.instance.SetProgressionMode(ProgressionMode.FAST);   //RUSH

- Add tutorial
Only appears when you are in NORMAL mode. This can be checked with the following line of code:

GameProgression.instance.isTutorial();  //returns boolean if it is the tutorial


- Loading screen with some flavour text
Something simple like 'You can run but never hide!'

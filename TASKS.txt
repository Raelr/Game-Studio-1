All tasks to do in Hyperpocalypse before showcase:

- Prompt to choose NORMAL or RUSH mode that'll just run one of these lines of code:     
GameProgression.instance.SetProgressionMode(ProgressionMode.SLOW);   //Regular
or
GameProgression.instance.SetProgressionMode(ProgressionMode.FAST);   //RUSH


- Loading screen with some flavour text
- Insanity meter/time UI changes color to level color
- Death shows you the score of the level, with a highscore system in place (PlayerPrefs)
- Soft sound for completing a level (add some subtle pitch variance)
- Escape key quickly exits out of the level and takes you to menu
- Disable the cursor in gameplay
- Subtle particle effect when you enter a blue boost field
- Remove 'Cursed Cosmos' on menu
- Controller 2 haptic vibrations (long vibrate = lose health, or approach death, short vibrate = boost) - Sean
